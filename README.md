## Animal Disease Classification
This project uses machine learning to classify animal diseases based on observed symptoms. It implements a variety of classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict the likelihood of a disease being dangerous.

## Project Overview
**Dataset:** Consists of animal symptoms and labels indicating disease severity.
**Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.
**Modeling:** Several classifiers were trained and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Features
- **Ensemble Model:** Voting classifier for combined model predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Comprehensive classification report for each model, detailing performance metrics.

## Requirements
**Python libraries:** 
   - Pandas
   - Seaborn
   - Matplotlib
   - Sklearn
